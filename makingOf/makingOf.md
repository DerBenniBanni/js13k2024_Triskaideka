# Making of "Aargh! Triskaideka attacks!" for the js13kgames.com Jam
WORK IN PROGRESS!
## The theme was announced! "Triskaidekaphobia"

**"Triskaidekaphobia" ?!?!?** What the fraggle?

My first reactions were like this:

* looking at the screen in disbelief
* hit [F5]
* stare again at the screen
* mumble a very slow "What..... the..... fraggle ?"
* google the word
* read wikipedia entry
* stare at the screen
* mumble an even slower "What..... the..... fraggle ?"
* look at the white wall behind my monitor... (quite some time)
* mumble "oh my... this sadistic end3r... ! I bet he is still laughing..."
