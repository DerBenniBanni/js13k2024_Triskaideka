# Making of "Aargh! Triskaideka attacks!" for the js13kgames.com Jam
WORK IN PROGRESS!
## The theme was announced! "Triskaidekaphobia"

**"Triskaidekaphobia" ?!?!?** What the fraggle?

My first reactions were like this:

* looking at the screen in disbelief
* hit [F5]
* stare again at the screen
* mumble a very slow "What..... the..... fraggle ?"
* google the word
* read wikipedia entry
* stare at the screen
* mumble an even slower "What..... the..... fraggle ?"
* look at the white wall behind my monitor... (quite some time)
* mumble "oh my... this sadistic end3r... ! I bet he is still laughing..."

## Theme-brainstorming-result

Aliens. The "Triskaideka" are an alien race everyone is afraid of.

## The first player character
The first iteration of gameplay featured a snake-like creature as player to be controlled by gamepad or keyboard.

### Idea and concept prototypes
I wanted to add a procedurally generated creature, so i played a bit with a bunch of circles following the mouse in different distances. Which looked nice when the mouse was in movement, but it streched to much when the mouse was too fast, and collapsed into one point when the mouse stopped.

So i came up with the idea, that one circle should follow the previous one in a defines distance, and only the first is controlled by keyboard.

So the position of the "head" of the "snake" was now directly updated (each frame) depending on keyboard-inputs and the segments of the tail were updated to move in the directon of the previous segment until the desired distance is reached (essentiall i calculation the vector between the two midpoints of the segment, then clamping that vector to the distance of the segment and setting the child-segment to this new position). This looked pretty organic.

Then i added a hull for the creature by calculation the 90Â° positions left and right and connecting them by an outline.
